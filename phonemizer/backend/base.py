    Provides a common interface to all backends. The central method is
    `phonemize()`

    Parameters
    ----------
    language (str): The language code of the input text, must be supported by
      the backend. If `backend` is 'segments', the language can be a file with
      a grapheme to phoneme mapping.

    preserve_punctuation (bool): When True, will keep the punctuation in the
      phonemized output. Not supported by the 'espeak-mbrola' backend. Default
      to False and remove all the punctuation.

    punctuation_marks (str): The punctuation marks to consider when dealing
      with punctuation, either for removal or preservation. Default to
      Punctuation.default_marks().

    logger (logging.Logger): the logging instance where to send
      messages. If not specified, use the default system logger.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError if the backend is not available of if the `language` cannot be
    initialized.
