    """Multilingual text to phonemes converter

    Return a phonemized version of an input `text`, given its `language` and a
    phonemization `backend`.

    Note
    ----
    To improve the processing speed it is better to minimize the calls to this
    function: provide the input text as a list and call phonemize() a single
    time is much more efficient than calling it on each element of the list.
    Indeed the initialization of the phonemization backend can be expensive,
    especially for espeak. In one exemple,

    Do this:

    >>> text = [line1, line2, ...]
    >>> phonemize(text, ...)

    Not this:

    >>> for line in text:
    >>>     phonemize(line, ...)

    Parameters
    ----------
    text (str or list of str): The text to be phonemized. Any empty line will
      be ignored. If `text` is an str, it can be multiline (lines being
      separated by \n). If `text` is a list, each element is considered as a
      separated line. Each line is considered as a text utterance.

    language (str): The language code of the input text, must be supported by
      the backend. If `backend` is 'segments', the language can be a file with
      a grapheme to phoneme mapping.

    backend (str, optional): The software backend to use for phonemization,
      must be 'festival' (US English only is supported, coded 'en-us'),
      'espeak', 'espeak-mbrola' or 'segments'.

    separator (Separator): string separators between phonemes, syllables and
      words, default to separator.default_separator. Syllable separator is
      considered only for the festival backend. Word separator is ignored by
      the 'espeak-mbrola' backend. Initialize it as follows:
        >>> from phonemizer.separator import Separator
        >>> separator = Separator(phone='-', word=' ')

    strip (bool, optional): If True, don't output the last word and phone
      separators of a token, default to False.

    prepend_text (bool, optional): When True, returns a pair (input utterance,
      phonemized utterance) for each line of the input text. When False,
      returns only the phonemized utterances. Default to False

    preserve_punctuation (bool, optional): When True, will keep the punctuation
      in the phonemized output. Not supported by the 'espeak-mbrola' backend.
      Default to False and remove all the punctuation.

    punctuation_marks (str, optional): The punctuation marks to consider when
      dealing with punctuation, either for removal or preservation. Default to
      Punctuation.default_marks().

    with_stress (bool, optional): This option is only valid for the 'espeak'
      backend. When True the stresses on phonemes are present (stresses
      characters are ˈ'ˌ). When False stresses are removed. Default to False.

    tie (bool or char, optional): This option is only valid for the 'espeak'
      backend with espeak>=1.49. It is incompatible with phone separator. When
      not False, use a tie character within multi-letter phoneme names. When
      True, the char 'U+361' is used (as in d͡ʒ), 'z' means ZWJ character,
      default to False.

    language_switch (str, optional): Espeak can output some words in another
      language (typically English) when phonemizing a text. This option setups
      the policy to use when such a language switch occurs. Three values are
      available: 'keep-flags' (the default), 'remove-flags' or
      'remove-utterance'. The 'keep-flags' policy keeps the language switching
      flags, for example "(en) or (jp)", in the output. The 'remove-flags'
      policy removes them and the 'remove-utterance' policy removes the whole
      line of text including a language switch. This option is only valid for
      the 'espeak' backend.

    words_mismatch (str, optional): Espeak can join two consecutive words or
      drop some words, yielding a word count mismatch between orthographic and
      phonemized text. This option setups the policy to use when such a words
      count mismatch occurs. Three values are available: 'ignore' (the default)
      which do nothing, 'warn' which issue a warning for each mismatched line,
      and 'remove' which remove the mismatched lines from the output.

    njobs (int): The number of parallel jobs to launch. The input text is split
      in `njobs` parts, phonemized on parallel instances of the backend and the
      outputs are finally collapsed.

    logger (logging.Logger): the logging instance where to send messages. If
      not specified, use the default system logger.

    Returns
    -------
    phonemized text (str or list of str) : The input `text` phonemized for the
      given `language` and `backend`. The returned value has the same type of
      the input text (either a list or a string), excepted if `prepend_input`
      is True where the output is forced as a list of pairs (input_text,
      phonemized text).

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError if the `backend` is not valid or is valid but not installed,
      if the `language` is not supported by the `backend`, if any incompatible
      options are used.
