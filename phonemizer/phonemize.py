    """Multilingual text to phonemes converter

    Return a phonemized version of an input `text`, given its
    `language` and a phonemization `backend`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text (str or list of str): The text to be phonemized. Any empty
       line will be ignored. If `text` is an str, it can be multiline
       (lines being separated by \n). If `text` is a list, each
       element is considered as a separated line. Each line is
       considered as a text utterance.

    language (str): The language code of the input text, must be
      supported by the backend. If `backend` is 'segments', the
      language can be a file with a grapheme to phoneme mapping.

    backend (str): The software backend to use for phonemization, must
      be 'festival' (US English only is supported, coded 'en-us'),
      'espeak', 'espeak-mbrola' or 'segments'.

    separator (Separator): string separators between phonemes, syllables and
      words, default to separator.default_separator. Syllable separator is
      considered only for the festival backend. Word separator is ignored by
      the 'espeak-mbrola' backend.

    strip (bool): If True, don't output the last word and phone
      separators of a token, default to False.

    preserve_punctuation (bool): When True, will keep the punctuation in the
        phonemized output. Not supported by the 'espeak-mbrola' backend.
        Default to False and remove all the punctuation.

    punctuation_marks (str): The punctuation marks to consider when dealing
        with punctuation, either for removal or preservation. Default to
        Punctuation.default_marks().

    with_stress (bool): This option is only valid for the 'espeak' backend.
      When True the stresses on phonemes are present (stresses characters are
      ˈ'ˌ). When False stresses are removed. Default to False.

    language_switch (str): Espeak can output some words in another language
      (typically English) when phonemizing a text. This option setups the
      policy to use when such a language switch occurs. Three values are
      available: 'keep-flags' (the default), 'remove-flags' or
      'remove-utterance'. The 'keep-flags' policy keeps the language switching
      flags, for example "(en) or (jp)", in the output. The 'remove-flags'
      policy removes them and the 'remove-utterance' policy removes the whole
      line of text including a language switch. This option is only valid for
      the 'espeak' backend.

    njobs (int): The number of parallel jobs to launch. The input text
      is split in `njobs` parts, phonemized on parallel instances of
      the backend and the outputs are finally collapsed.

    logger (logging.Logger): the logging instance where to send
      messages. If not specified, use the default system logger.

    Returns
    -------
    phonemized text (str or list of str) : The input `text` phonemized
      for the given `language` and `backend`. The returned value has
      the same type of the input text (either a list or a string).

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError if the `backend` is not valid or is valid but not installed,
      if the `language` is not supported by the `backend`, if with_stress` or
      `language_switch` are used but the backend is not 'espeak'.
