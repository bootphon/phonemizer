# Summary

Phones are elementary sounds the speech is made of, on which syllables and words
are built. The transcription of texts from their orthographic form into a
phonetic alphabet is an important requirement in various applications related to
speech and language processing, for instance for text to speech systems.
`Phonemizer` is a Python package addressing precisely this issue: it transcribes
a text from its orthographic representation into a phonetic one. The package is
user-friendly and exposes a single high-level `phonemize` function, a lower
lovel API, and is also available as a command-line interface. It supports about
a hundred different languages and provides end-user functionalities such as
punctuation preservation, phones accentuation, tokenization at
phone/syllable/word levels, as well as parallel processing of large input texts.


# Statement of Need

Whereas the high-level features introduced above are implemented directly by
`phonemizer`, the phonetic transcription itself is delegated to third party
backends, wrapped in an homogeneous interface by the package. The default
backend used by `phonemizer` is eSpeak [@espeak:2019], a text to speech software
built on linguistic expertise and hand written transcription rules. It
transcribes text into the International Phonetic Alphabet and supports more than
a hundred languages. Using MBROLA voices [@mbrola:2019], available for about 35
languages, the eSpeak backend transcribes text in the SAMPA computer readable
phonetic alphabet. Festival [@festival:2014] is another text to speech software
used as a backend for `phonemizer`. It is available for American English only,
and uses a non standard phoneset for transcription, but this backend is the only
one to meet the requirement of some applications by preserving syllable
boundaries of transcribed texts. The third `phonemizer` backend is Segments
[@forkel:2019], a Python package providing Unicode Standard tokenization
routines and orthography segmentation. It relies on a grapheme to phoneme
mapping to generate the transcription. This backend is mostly useful for
low-resource languages, for which users with linguistic expertise can write
their own mappings. Six languages are provided as examples with `phonemizer`:
Chintang, Cree, Inuktitut, Japanese, Sesotho, and Yucatec.

Text to phones transcription is a critical need in different applications
related to natural language and speech processing. So far, the `phonemizer`
package has been used in the preprocessing pipeline of various deep learning
text to speech systems [@mozilla:2021; @asideas:2021; @espnet:2018]. It has also
been used as a preprocessing step in word segmentation studies regarding the
role of speech prosody in segmentability [@ludusan:2017] and the psychology of
child development [@cristia:2019;@bernard:2020]. A phonetic transcription
generated by the package was used to evaluate a phone discrimination task for
the Zero Speech Challenge 2017 [@dunbar:2017]. The `phonemizer` is also very
suitable to prepare datasets for their use with the Kaldi speech recognition
toolkit [@povey:2011], where a phonetic transcription of text is a requirement
for various algorithms. The package can also be used to generate forced
alignments of speech corpora, an important part of the speech-related research
pipeline whereby an acoustic signal is segmented and aligned with a text
transcript. The most impactful software in this field
[@rosenfelder:2014;@mcauliffe:2017] requires a pronunciation dictionary to
transcribe words into phonemes. Such dictionaries, when available, can be
non-exhaustive, thus requiring experimenter transcription, model training, and/or
data exclusion. Replacing the dictionary by the use of the `phonemizer` can
therefore improve the overall pipeline and alignment quality for supported
languages. Finally, the `phonemizer` shows promises for the linguistic analysis
of low-resource languages, where a major problem is the lack of grapheme to
phoneme mapping [@barth:2020] or comprehensive pronunciation dictionaries
[@johnson:2018;@cristia:2020]. In such cases, compiling a grapheme to phoneme
map to be used by the Segments backend would be easier and more efficient than
compiling an exhaustive pronunciation dictionary.
